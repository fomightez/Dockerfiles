# Dockerfiles


*(At first I thought the automated build settings at Docker Hub is based on a repo having a single Dockerfile, and so I thought I needed a separate repo for each. But [this repo](https://github.com/27Bslash6/docker) and [this one](https://github.com/andrejsavikin/Dockerfiles) indicate otherwise, and you can see the resulting builds [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/funkygibbon/) and [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/andrejsavikin/ubuntu-openjdk-8-jre/), respectively. Now I sort of wish I didn't remove my recent sub-directory hierarchy. Although if build a bunch together, might sometime encounter Docker Hub's restrictions on how long a build of a repo can be limited to? see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34440753/docker-hub-timeout-in-automated-build/34588866#34588866) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36948145/chain-automated-builds-in-the-same-docker-hub-repository) for the limits info.)*  

I want to easily track my Docker efforts, but for now have separate repos for those efforts, and so I made this markdown file to do this.
