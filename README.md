# Dockerfiles


I may be wrong, but it seems the automated build settings at Docker Hub is based on a repo having a single Dockerfile, and so I think I need a separate repo for each. Unsure but I am going to keep my eyes open for examples where it isn't so.  
As a result, I want to easily track my Docker efforts and so I made this markdown file to do this.
